## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building the front end, creating reusable components, and managing state.
- **Google Books API**: This API was used to fetch book information to display dynamic content such as book titles, authors, and descriptions.
- **Netlify**: Used for hosting and deploying the project.
- **HTML/CSS**: Markup and styling languages used for structuring and styling the web pages.
- **JavaScript**: Object-oriented programming language used for interactivity of website.

## Approach Taken

1. **Initial Planning**:
   - The project began with planning out the features and layout for a library website that fetches book data using the Google Books API. I wanted to do this to showcase my love for reading, and share with friends what I'm reading.

2. **React Programming**:
   - React was used to build the front-end. I organized components that helped with different routes of the website.
   - Different components such as `Favorites` and `HaveRead` expressed the routing logic within each page of the website. They also linked to different portions of my Google Books Library, called *shelves*.

3. **Fetching Data**:
   - The Google Books API was integrated into the app to allow users to search for books by title and fetch related details.
   - API calls were managed using the fetchBook helper function inside the `fetchBooks.js` file.

4. **Styling**:
   - The book objects in each page were organized as individual cards to give better separation between the different books and for aesthetics. I have been a huge fan of using the card style of organizing different objects since learning of it from a Udemy course.

4. **Deployment**:
   - The project was deployed online using Netlify, which has access to my GitHub repository.

## Usage Instructions

**Explore What I'm reading**:
   - In each section, I have a different category of my books:
      - `Favorites` which is the main collection, shelf in Google Books speak, which shows my favorite books that I have read.
      - `Reading Now` has the book(s) I'm in the middle of reading presently
      - `To Read` has book(s) I would like to read soon that I have already purchased.
      - `Have Read` is the largest collection. This is every book in Google Books, that I have read recently.

## Unsolved Problems/Future Fixes

1. **Book Summaries**:
   - The summaries are cut off. I would like to either see how I make extract the entire text, while not cluttering my page, or perhaps give an optional link to click on to continue reading the rest of the summary.

2. **Add More Books**:
   - The power in using an API like Google Books, is reusability in code to fetch many similar pieces of data (JSON objects representing books). I honestly never used Google Books before this project, so I would like to make this library more indictative of my readings, by adding every book from my Audible/Kindle apps as well as paper ones. 

3. **Add Shopping Capabilities**:
   - Would like to perhaps connect to Amazon API as well to get links for every book so readers can quickly purchase any book they may be interested in.

## Conclusion

This project allowed me to expand my knowledge of React, APIs, and overall web development. While there are some aspects to improve upon, Iâ€™m excited about the potential to grow this application into something of higher complexity and interactivity so I can really share my love of reading with others.
